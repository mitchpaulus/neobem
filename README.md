# idf-plus

`idf-plus` is a preprocessor programming language intended for the idf input files for EnergyPlus.

Have you ever wanted to:

- Use variables in your input file?
- Break out sections into templates?
- Use arithmetic?
- Loop over lists?
- Easily incorporate work from others?

If so, `idf-plus` is what you have always wanted.

# Design Goals

- Be a superset of the idf input file format.
- Expose simple programming concepts for those unfamiliar with
  programming
- Cross-platform. All users should be able to use tool regardless of
  OS.
- High quality documentation. Building energy modeling professionals
  shouldn't have to also be software engineers.
