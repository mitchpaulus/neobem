# FAQ

**What's with the name?**

The name actually has gone through several iterations. It began as
idf-plus as a play on "EnergyPlus" and "C++". However, I realized that
other input files, such as the format expected by the DOE-2 engine,
could also use this, so I decided to remove the 'idf' portion from the
name.

It then went to 'bemp', because I wanted something short, pronounceable,
and it could stand for many things:

1. "Building Energy Modeling Programming" since that's what we're
   doing here.
2. A play on the ASHRAE certification "Building Energy Modeling
   Professional"

I didn't continue with this name since it was not unique, and searching
for 'bemp' online comes up with the ASHRAE certification items along
with other acronyms.

So it's current name is Neobem. It's partially an ode to
[Neovim](https://neovim.io), the text editor that I will do most raw
editing of idf files and now these input files. Plus, throwing 'Neo' in
front of nouns makes things cooler, right? Searching the internet for
Neobem didn't result in hits, so that should be helpful for people in
the future searching for help.

The executable name is `nbem`{.sh}, to match the expected extension for
these files. I do realize this is going to have to be front and center
in the documentation for those attempting to run `neobem.exe` and not
finding it. But that's the price you pay for a unique name and
reasonably short executable and file extension.
