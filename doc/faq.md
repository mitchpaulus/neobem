**What's with the name?**

The name is what it is. I chose it because it's short, pronounceable,
and it can stand for many things:

1. "Building Energy Modeling Programming" since that's what we're
   doing here.
2. "Building Energy Modeling Plus" as a play on "EnergyPlus" and
   "C++".
3. A play on the ASHRAE certification "Building Energy Modeling
   Professional"

I do style it as all lowercase (e.g. `bemp`), since that is the actual
executable name, and it helps to differentiate it from the above.
