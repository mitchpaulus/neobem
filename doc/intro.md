While creating you building energy simulation input files, have you ever wanted to:

- Use variables?
- Break out sections into custom templates?
- Use arithmetic?
- Build objects directly from Excel data?
- Loop over lists?
- Easily incorporate work from others?
- Do all this without setting up a full Python or R working environment?

If so, Neobem is what you have always wanted.

At is core, Neobem is a command line application that follows the Unix
principle of doing one thing and doing it well. That thing is compiling
an expressive programming syntax into building energy simulation input.

It is a [Unix filter
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software)), taking input
via standard input or a file and writing the results to standard output.
It is designed to play one role in larger processing pipelines.

I hope you find it as useful as I do.
