Usage: nbem [options..] [input file]
Compile Neobem file to idf output

With no [input file], input is read from file named 'in.nbem' in the
current directory. If the input file is '-', input is read from standard
input rather than from a file.

OPTIONS:

-h, --help              show this help and exit
-f, --fmt               format file instead of compiling
-o, --output <filename> output file name, default is standard output
-v, --version           print version number and exit
